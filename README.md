# Unexpected :nth-child Styling in Nested Elements

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the CSS `:nth-child` pseudo-class selector when used with a formula (4n+2) and applied to nested elements.  The selector's behavior becomes unpredictable, applying styling to elements in a manner inconsistent with its intended pattern.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS. The `bugSolution.css` file offers a potential solution or workaround to achieve the intended result.  The solution may involve adjusting the selector's approach (e.g. alternative selectors or more specific targeting) or restructuring the HTML.

This issue highlights the importance of careful consideration when using the `:nth-child` selector in complex HTML structures.
