Several approaches can resolve this issue, depending on the exact desired outcome and HTML structure. Here are two potential solutions:

**Solution 1: Using a more specific selector:**
Instead of relying on `:nth-child`, target the elements directly using classes or more specific selectors if possible, which provides more reliable and predictable styling.

```css
.container .item:nth-child(2n+1) {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Here, we've assumed that each item within `.container` has a class `item`.  Adjust this based on the actual structure. 

**Solution 2: Restructuring the HTML (if possible):**
If it is feasible to change your HTML structure, consider refactoring it to have a flatter structure or add specific classes to elements that require unique styling. This would significantly enhance the ease and correctness of CSS styling.

Choose the solution that best suits your project's constraints and the specific requirements for styling.  Remember to test your solution thoroughly across various browser configurations.
